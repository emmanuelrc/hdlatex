# hdlatex
This class should help you use latex for your master at the university heidelberg. 

It implements all needed features to comply with th IPMB format.

I know that it is not very customizable, I used it for my intership report,s my ,,Wissenschaftliche Vortr√§ge'', project proposal and my master thesis. I sometime had to adjust the .cls to make everythink possible.

## The files explained

- biblatex.cfg: configure biblatex/biber to comply with cell citation style as requested (2017). Has to be in the same folder as .tex file
- bibliothek.bib: you can put citations here or chnage this in the example.tex
- example.tex: This is your thesis, report or whatever .tex file. Make changes here
- hdprotokoll.cls: The class. This has to be in the same folder as your .tex file
